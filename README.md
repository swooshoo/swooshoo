## 👋 What doing?
My name is Eliot, and I've recently completed a Bachelor's in Mathematics @ UC Riverside, 2025.

My strengths lie in **data analysis, visualization, and dashboard development using Python and SQL.** I'm highly proficient in tools like **Streamlit, PythonGUI, and Dash** for interactive data applications and dashboards, and Python development/libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

I have experience working with **SQL databases for data extraction and analysis**, and I'm skilled in **data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis** to uncover insights. Additionally, I’m familiar with **experiment design and A/B testing principles**, making me effective in supporting data-driven decision-making. 

Some of my projects required I spend 70% of my time getting user feedback and pitching my ideas to potential users, from close friends & family to local businesses and corporate entities. One example is cold-calling and driving to local emergency shelters, firehouses, and churches gathering user-experience data for my inventory tracker, LAyudar.

I enjoy putting my ideas and passions into actionable and usable code, and would love to work in an environment that challenges me further. 

## 💭 Outside of Tech

Anything that involves keeping in contact with friends and meeting new people. I'm an introvert at heart but the truth is that a core of human experiences is meeting others and sharing stories and experiences.
