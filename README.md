ðŸ‘‹ Hello hello!
My name is Eliot, and I will be completing my Bachelor's in Mathematics from the University of California, Riverside.

My strengths lie in data analysis, visualization, and automation using Python and SQL. I'm highly proficient in tools like Streamlit for interactive data applications and dashboards, as well as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

I have experience working with SQL databases for data extraction and analysis, and I'm skilled in data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis to uncover insights. Additionally, Iâ€™m familiar with experiment design and A/B testing principles, making me effective in supporting data-driven decision-making.

I'm also developing my expertise in machine learning concepts for prediction and classification tasks using libraries like scikit-learn. My focus on clear data storytelling and automation through tools like Streamlit helps streamline reporting and enhance business decision-making.

ðŸ’­ Outside of Tech...

I actively pursue personal growth and balance through activities like going to the gym, which helps me stay disciplined and goal-oriented. Iâ€™m also an avid PC gamer and movie enthusiast, where I enjoy strategy and storytelling. Exploring cafes has become a creative outlet for me, as I find inspiration in new environments and conversations, often sparking fresh perspectives for my projects.

These interests keep me curious, adaptable, and open-mindedâ€”qualities, and if you'd like to learn more, check out my [LinkedIn!]([https://website-name.com](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swooshoo/))
